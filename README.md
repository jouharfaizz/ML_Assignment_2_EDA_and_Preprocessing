# ML_Assignment_2_EDA_and_Preprocessing
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing, the project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning.

Dataset

Name: Empolyee.csv

Description: A dataset with challenges such as missing values, outliers, and categorical features that require preprocessing.

Key Components

1. Data Exploration (Score: 2)

Explore the data and list the unique values in each feature.

Calculate the length of unique values for each feature.

Perform statistical analysis on the dataset.

Rename columns for better understanding and usability.

2. Data Cleaning (Score: 2)

Identify and treat missing or inappropriate values.

Replace the value 0 in the age column with NaN.

Handle null values using appropriate measures (removal or replacement with mean/median/mode).

Remove duplicate rows.

Detect and treat outliers in the data.

3. Data Analysis (Score: 2)

Filter the data for records where age > 40 and salary < 5000.

Create a plot showing the relationship between age and salary.

Count the number of individuals from each place and represent it visually.

4. Data Encoding (Score: 2)

Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as:

One-hot encoding

Label encoding

Ensure the encoded data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

5. Feature Scaling (Score: 2)

After encoding, scale the features using:

StandardScaler

MinMaxScaler

Steps to Execute the Project

Load the dataset and perform data exploration.

Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Analyze the data to extract insights and create visualizations.

Encode categorical variables into numerical formats.

Scale the features for machine learning compatibility.

Document all findings and preprocessing steps.

Requirements

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Software: Python (Jupyter Notebook recommended)

Output

Cleaned dataset with all preprocessing steps completed.

Visualizations for data analysis and insights.

Encoded and scaled dataset ready for machine learning.

Submission

Ensure all tasks are completed, documented, and submitted as a GitHub repository.
